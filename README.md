all the funds in ether through a multifirm account. All authorized participants will
be responsible for the Project (Victor Serrano y Antonio Conte), one of them
being a reliable third party, in case both parties do not reach an agreement with
the use of funds.. The wallet to be used is Gnosis multisign and will not have
security errors.

 The only reliable sources of official information will be on our
